# Algorithmic Searches

This project was developed for the **Reasoning and Agents course** at The University of Edinburgh. The project contains the implementation of Strategies & Algorithms used by AI Agents in decision-making processes.

## Methods Implemented

* AI Decision strategies
  * **MinMax**
  * **AlphaBeta Pruning**
* Search Algorithms
  * **Breadth-first search**
  * **Depth-firsts search**
  * **Iterative Deepening search**
  * **A Star Search**
  
### Description of Files

* **Inf2D1.hs** - Contains haskell implementation for all the methods mentioned above
* **TTTGame.hs** - contains code for displaying and checking a Tic-Tac-Toe game against the AI
* **PlayGame.hs** - contains code for playing several games against the AI
* **RobotPath.hs** - contains code for displaying the path the AI takes from the initial position to the destination while avoiding bad tiles
* **Main.hs** - contains the code for managing the app

The code from the last 4 files belongs to **Professor Vaishak Belle**. All the implementations of the alogrithms belong to me.

## Built With

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) - Functional Programming Language
